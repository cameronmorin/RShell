# assignment3

In this assignment, I implemented the precedence operators and the new test function

The test function returns true if the input file/directory exists,is a file, or is a directory
depending on the flag given(if there was a flag given).

The precedence operators allow for more direct, and accurate computation
of boolean logic, allowing for commands to be broken up into
their desired branches of logic.

In my code, I found a couple minor bugs:

1) If the user inputs a test function style input, but does
   not give appropriate syntax, there may be some error 
   depending on the exact input due to very strict
   string parsing

2) In some instances with uneven precedence operators, there was segmentation
   faults but I have found and fixed all known instances.



My partner withdrew from the class in the middle of week 8, so the 
remainder of the assignments will be completed by myself only.
